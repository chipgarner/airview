Read Garmin, Strava and [yourair](https://github.com/chipgarner/yourair) files and display on an interactive map using Geopandas

Reads GPS and time data from .gpx files. This works with Garmin and Strave .gpx files, I have not tested on others but it is likely to work. It reads .txt files from [yourair](https://github.com/chipgarner/yourair) and combines the files based on timestamps. It displays the results on an interactive map. https://www.garnertotalenergy.com/

It requires Geopanda, they have excellent instructions.
